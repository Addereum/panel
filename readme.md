# Pelican Panel

Pelican® is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go. Designed with security
in mind, Pelican runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive
UI to end users.

Stop settling for less. Make game servers a first class citizen on your platform.
